# Code Chalenge 7: linked-list-kth
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
https://github.com/HaneenHaashlamoun/data-structures-and-algorithms/pull/26

**Specifications**
- [x] Write the following method for the Linked List class:
        
    - [x] kth from end
        -  argument: a number, k, as a parameter.
        -  Return the node’s value that is k places from the tail of the linked list.
            - [x] You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

## Challenge

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
loop to get the length of linked list ,and if condition to find the node that matched the given k
